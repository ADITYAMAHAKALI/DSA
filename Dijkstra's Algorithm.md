# Dijkstra's Algorithm

> [!note] Description
> Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: $O(E + V \log V)$ using Min-Priority Queue.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(V)$.

## Implementation (Python)

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]

    while pq:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances
```
