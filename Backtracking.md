# Backtracking

> [!note] Description
> Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).

## Example: N-Queens Problem
```python
def is_safe(board, row, col, N):
    # Check this row on left side
    for i in range(col):
        if board[row][i] == 1:
            return False
    # Check upper diagonal on left side
    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False
    # Check lower diagonal on left side
    for i, j in zip(range(row, N, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False
    return True

def solve_nq_util(board, col, N):
    if col >= N:
        return True
    for i in range(N):
        if is_safe(board, i, col, N):
            board[i][col] = 1
            if solve_nq_util(board, col + 1, N):
                return True
            board[i][col] = 0 # Backtrack
    return False
```
