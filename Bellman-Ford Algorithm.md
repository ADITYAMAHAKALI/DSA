# Bellman-Ford Algorithm

> [!note] Description
> The Bellman-Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph. It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: $O(V \times E)$.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(V)$.

## Implementation (Python)

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self, vertices):
        self.V = vertices
        self.graph = []

    def add_edge(self, u, v, w):
        self.graph.append([u, v, w])

    def bellman_ford(self, src):
        dist = [float("Inf")] * self.V
        dist[src] = 0

        for _ in range(self.V - 1):
            for u, v, w in self.graph:
                if dist[u] != float("Inf") and dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + w

        for u, v, w in self.graph:
            if dist[u] != float("Inf") and dist[u] + w < dist[v]:
                print("Graph contains negative weight cycle")
                return

        return dist
```
